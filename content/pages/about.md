Hi there. I'm Marcos.

I'm a software engineer, originally from Brasília, Brazil, now based in Lisbon, Portugal. My work lies at the intersection of software development, data engineering, and building products that solve real problems.

## Background

I enjoy working on challenging technical problems and building things from the ground up. Whether it's designing scalable systems, diving into data pipelines, or crafting clean APIs, I find satisfaction in turning complex requirements into working software.

## Interests

Outside of work, I'm passionate about:

- Open source software
- Learning new programming languages
- Photography
- Exploring new places
