Hi there. I'm Marcos Augusto Barbosa.

I'm a machine learning engineer, originally from Brasília, Brazil, now based in Lisbon, Portugal. My work lies at the intersection of software development, data engineering, and building products that solve real problems.

I have graduated in Statistics at Universidade de Brasília and now I have been mainly working developing agentic systems.

## Background

I enjoy working on challenging technical problems and building things from the ground up. Whether it's designing scalable systems, diving into data pipelines, or crafting clean APIs, I find satisfaction in turning complex requirements into working software.

## Interests

Outside of work, I'm passionate about:

- Criptography
- Hiking
- Exploring new places
- Just having long conversations with close friends

## Get in touch
